This is the instruction to run the code. The code is used to compete the stress and SIFs.

The first step is generating meshes with MeshGeneration.py in the folder "Mesh". Two meshes are already generated and saved here, with cracklengths = 0.3 and 0.5. In the main program I'll use the C=0.3 case.

Main program is in Main.ipynb. In this script I import meshes from folder "Mesh" and get the displacement and stress solutions (saved in folder "Notched_Results"). The code is run in a jupyter notebook of FEniCS in a docker container.

The visualisation is done in Make_Figures.ipynb in the folder "Notched_Results". Here I plot the perturbation stress (net stress - lithostatic stress) with matplotlib. This program can run in a basic python environment and doesn't rely on FEniCS.
