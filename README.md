# Basal hydrofractures near sticky patches

This repository contains the code for the manuscript "Basal hydrofracture near sticky patches", which is planned to be submitted to Journal of Galciology. The work aims to study the hydrofracture propagation near the sticky patches that are regions with higher basal shear stress under glaciers or ice sheets.

## Description

Each folder named "Figure_n" (n=1,2,3...) contains the code to produce the corresponding figure in the manuscript. The computation relies on the open-source finite element library FEniCS (Logg and Wells, [2010](https://doi.org/10.1145/1731022.1731030)) and boundary element code developed by Davis, [2017](https://abdn.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/discovery/delivery/44ABE_INST:44ABE_VU1/12153058290005941?lang=en&viewerServiceCode=AlmaViewer).
